In order to run the MaliciosClient you can either
	create a windows console application with MaliciosClient.cpp in visual studio and run it there.
	or just run MaliciosClient.exe that can be found in the executables folder. 
the client takes the servers ip address or host name as an input argument.

have fun! :)
