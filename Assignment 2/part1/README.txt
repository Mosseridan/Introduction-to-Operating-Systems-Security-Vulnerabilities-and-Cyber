In order to run the exploit you can either
	create a windows console application with exploit.cpp in visual studio and run it there.
	or just run exploit.exe that can be found in the executables folder. 
the exploit dose not take any input anrguments and it should be started prior to the vunerable services execution.
if you move the explout.exe to a different folder make sure you move toExec.tmp and 1.tmp with it.


if you want to run the fix you can. 
in order to do so you should create a windows console application with it as its main.
and add a resource you want to be used as the child preccesses code.

have fun! :)
